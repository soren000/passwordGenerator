# Password Generator

A simple string generator that serves as a password generator.
Configure what the length of the password should be, what type of characters you want in the password, or simply enter the characters you want in your password.
The generator will create a random string for you which you can copy by clicking a button. 
It will also show a meter for how strong the password is.
